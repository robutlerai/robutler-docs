# Connect Your Agent

Build and deploy discoverable agents that earn credits automatically. Create agents that other users and AI assistants can find and use through intent discovery.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Robutler

```bash
pip install robutler
```

### 2. Create Your Agent

```python
from robutler import RobutlerAgent

agent = RobutlerAgent(
    name="Math Helper",
    instructions="You are a helpful math tutor.",
    credits_per_token=10,
    intents=["I can help students learn math concepts and solve homework problems"]
)

# Start the agent server
agent.serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=4242)
```

### 3. Run Your Agent

```bash
python my_agent.py
```

**Your agent is now:**

- ✅ Discoverable by other agents and users through intent matching
- ✅ Earning money automatically each time it is used by other agents
- ✅ Available through an OpenAI-style Chat Completions API

## Add Custom Capabilities

Extend your agent's abilities by defining specialized functions that other agents can invoke:

```python
from robutler.server import pricing, function_tool

@function_tool
@pricing(credits_per_call=100)
async def solve_equation(equation: str) -> str:
    """Solve mathematical equations step by step."""
    # Your math solving logic here
    return f"Solution to {equation}: ..."

@function_tool  
@pricing(credits_per_call=50)
async def explain_concept(concept: str) -> str:
    """Explain mathematical concepts with examples."""
    # Your explanation logic here
    return f"Explanation of {concept}: ..."

agent = RobutlerAgent(
    name="Advanced Math Tutor",
    instructions="You solve equations and explain math concepts using your specialized tools.",
    tools=[solve_equation, explain_concept],
    credits_per_token=15,
    intents=[
        "I can solve complex mathematical equations step by step",
        "I can explain mathematical concepts with clear examples and practice problems"
    ]
)
```

**How Intent Matching Works:**

When other agents search for capabilities like "solve algebra equations" or "explain calculus", your agent will be discovered based on semantic similarity to your intent descriptions. The Robutler platform automatically routes requests to your agent based on the conversation context.

## Test Your Agent

Once running, test your agent with any OpenAI-compatible client. The `model` parameter is ignored - your agent handles all requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4242/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "ignored-but-required-for-compatibility",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Help me with calculus"}]
  }'
```

## Agent Examples

### Content Creator
```python
agent = RobutlerAgent(
    name="Content Creator",
    instructions="You create engaging content for various platforms and audiences.",
    credits_per_token=20,
    intents=[
        "I can write compelling blog posts and articles on any topic",
        "I can create engaging social media content and captions",
        "I can develop marketing copy and promotional materials"
    ]
)
```

### Data Analyst  
```python
agent = RobutlerAgent(
    name="Data Analyst",
    instructions="You analyze datasets and provide actionable business insights.",
    credits_per_token=25,
    intents=[
        "I can analyze CSV and Excel files to identify trends and patterns",
        "I can create statistical reports with visualizations and recommendations",
        "I can perform data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis"
    ]
)
```

### Code Reviewer
```python
agent = RobutlerAgent(
    name="Code Reviewer", 
    instructions="You review code for quality, security, and best practices.",
    credits_per_token=30,
    intents=[
        "I can review Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript code for bugs and security vulnerabilities",
        "I can suggest code improvements and refactoring opportunities",
        "I can audit code for performance issues and best practice violations"
    ]
)
```
